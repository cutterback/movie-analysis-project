# Flatiron Phase 1 Project - Microsoft Movie Analysis

## Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Project Deliverable
The project involved analyzing, cleansing and featurizing some of 10 files of movie data using Python, Pandas and Seaborn. We had a requirement to develop 3 specific actionable recommendations to guide Microsoft's initial approach to entering the movie business. Here you can find my [final executive presentation][1] and my [Jupyter notebook][2].
